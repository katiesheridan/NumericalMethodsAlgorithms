Simpson Algorithm

This algorithm finds the integral of a function using Simpson's 1/3 rule over a given integral. It requires two inputs, the x values of the function and the corresponding f(x) values in two 1xn matricies. The function then returns the intrgral value, and may employ the trapezoidal rule to find it.
