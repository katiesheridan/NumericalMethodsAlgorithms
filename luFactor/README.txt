LU Decomposition Algorithm

This algorithm is performs the LU decomposition of a function to find the L and U matrices from an initial n x n matrix of coefficients.
It required an initial matrix, and returns the upper triangular matrix (U), the lower triangular matrix (L), and the pivoting matrix (P).
